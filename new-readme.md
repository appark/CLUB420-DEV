# CLUB420 - AGE GATE SYSTEM

## Overview

The age gate on Club420.com is a **custom-built compliance layer** implemented directly into the Divi WordPress theme. This modal-based gate ensures that **only users aged 21+** can access any content on the WordPress site ‚Äî including homepages, WooCommerce sections, and all landing pages ‚Äî before any store, product, or Blaze ECOM content is loaded.

Unlike Blaze‚Äôs built-in age gate, which only appears on `/menu/*` proxy URLs, this custom implementation ensures full-site compliance and seamless integration into the user experience.

---

## üî• Why We Built Our Own Age Gate

Blaze ECOM provides its own age verification modal ‚Äî but only within its embedded menu environment:

* ‚úÖ Only appears on Blaze `/menu/` URLs
* ‚ùå Does NOT protect homepage, landing pages, WooCommerce carousels, etc.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Creates a compliance gap for underage users landing on `/`, `/fstreet`, `/highway80`, or other content

üëâ To solve this, we **custom-coded our own age gate**, injected via Divi‚Äôs Body JS, that appears immediately upon site entry ‚Äî before any store logic or redirection is possible.

This prevents ANY cannabis product content or imagery from loading **until verification is confirmed**.

---

## Behavior Flow

```text
User lands on ANY Club420.com page (including subdomains)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> Custom age gate modal appears (unless localStorage is already set)
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> User selects "21+" or "Under 21"
         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ If "Under 21" ‚Üí redirect to Google (denial path)
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ If "21+" ‚Üí store key in localStorage ‚Üí allow access to page
```

Once accepted, the gate won‚Äôt reappear unless the user clears their localStorage manually.

## Code Breakdown

### üß† JS Logic (from `body-js.json`)

```js
if (!localStorage.getItem("club420-age-gate")) {
  const modalHTML = `
    <div class="club420-age-modal">
      <div class="modal-inner">
        <h2>Are you 21 or older?</h2>
        <div class="modal-buttons">
          <button class="age-yes">Yes</button>
          <button class="age-no">No</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>`;

  document.body.insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend", modalHTML);
  document.body.classList.add("club420-age-body-lock");

  document.querySelector(".age-yes").addEventListener("click", () => {
    localStorage.setItem("club420-age-gate", "true");
    document.querySelector(".club420-age-modal").remove();
    document.body.classList.remove("club420-age-body-lock");
  });

  document.querySelector(".age-no").addEventListener("click", () => {
    window.location.href = "https://www.google.com";
  });
}
```

### üé® CSS Styling (from `divi-css-code.json`)

```css
.club420-age-modal {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #000;
  color: #fff;
  z-index: 999999;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  animation: fadeIn 0.25s ease-out;
}

.club420-age-body-lock {
  overflow: hidden !important;
  height: 100vh !important;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}
```

## File Map

| Component     | File                 | Notes                                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| JS Logic      | `body-js.json`       | Handles modal injection, button logic, and localStorage |
| CSS Styling   | `divi-css-code.json` | Controls visual overlay and body lock                   |
| DOM Injection | JS Only              | No static HTML file ‚Äì modal created dynamically         |

---

## Integration Dependencies

* ‚úÖ Runs **before all other JS logic**, including store selector and Woo filters
* ‚úÖ Ensures compliance before showing ANY store/product content
* ‚úÖ Functions even on mobile or in private browsing
* ‚ùå Not a plugin ‚Äî uses inline JS and Divi custom code modules only
* ‚ùå No cookies used (localStorage only)

---

## Developer Notes

* To **manually test the modal**, run:

```js
localStorage.removeItem("club420-age-gate")
```

* Be sure your JS is inside a `DOMContentLoaded` block to prevent modal from firing too early
* You may add test flags like `console.log("Age gate modal triggered")` for debugging

---

## Compliance Summary

* Prevents underage users from accessing:

  * WordPress homepage
  * Divi pages
  * WooCommerce carousels
  * All embedded Blaze links
* Required by state cannabis compliance laws for all digital content

---

## Works With:

* ‚úÖ WooCommerce carousels (see `03-woocommerce-filters.md`)
* ‚úÖ Store selector logic (see `02-store-selector.md`)
* ‚úÖ All Blaze menu links (see `04-button-injector.md`)

---

## Conclusion

The CLUB420 age gate is a **critical compliance layer** that guarantees no product or cannabis-related content is visible until a user confirms they are 21+. It is lightweight, hardcoded, and fully decoupled from Blaze ‚Äî giving Club420 full control across the entire WordPress multisite structure.
